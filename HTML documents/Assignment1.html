		1. Dogs noses are wet to help absorb scent chemicals
		This amazing dog fact might answer a long-standing question that dog owners have.
		Why are dogs noses wet? Vetstreet says that the answer is that dogâ€™s noses are wet to help them absorb scent chemicals!
		Their nose secretes a special mucus that helps to absorb these chemicals, and
		then they lick their noses to sample them, helping them understand what the smell is.
