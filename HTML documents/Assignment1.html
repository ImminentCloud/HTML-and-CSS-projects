		1. Dogs noses are wet to help absorb scent chemicals
		This amazing dog fact might answer a long-standing question that dog owners have.
		Why are dogs noses wet? Vetstreet says that the answer is that dog’s noses are wet to help them absorb scent chemicals!
		Their nose secretes a special mucus that helps to absorb these chemicals, and
		then they lick their noses to sample them, helping them understand what the smell is.
